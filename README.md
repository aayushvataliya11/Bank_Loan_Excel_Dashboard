Dataset used in this project is the "Loan Dataset" of a Bank located in  numerous states of USA.

"In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

This report consists of three views :
1. Summary: (Major KPIs, Good Loan vs Bad Loan Data KPIs, Loan Status KPIs)
2. Overview: (KPIs related to Number of Applications by months, state, term, EMP length, Purpose, Home Ownership)
3. Details: (Its a detailed grid view i.e. dataset in table format)
